Sir or Madam,

 

For one year, I used another server hosting than yours for my domain named « digital-streetart.com ». I subscribed to your PostGIS hosting service recently and I want to use the same domain. I already ask iFastNet for my EPP code but I still don’t have a reply.

I absolutely want to use this specific domain « digital-streetart.com ».

What solution do you have for me to be able to use it ?

If you don’t have any, it is useless for me to keep my subscription with you.


Regards
